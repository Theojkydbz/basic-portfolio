# Context
<p class="marge">During the containment, I managed the organization of an event within the school, HACKARANTAINE is a hackathon on discord and my role was to make contact with mentors/potential participants, I was in charge of the whole upstream phase of the event. I then decided to participate as the rest of the collective that was in charge of the event did not need any reinforcement. After the hackarantaine I decide with an industrial design student to continue to think around this project and we will make a video prototype </p>

## Concept

<p class="marge">With SmartDock, we want to connect real space to a digital space. Create a natural link between what you can do with our smartphone and the real life context.</p>
