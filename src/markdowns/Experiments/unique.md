# Unique
During summer 2019, after a year full of creative codding experiments, I experiments a lot with vue.js and want to became better in software prototype in order 
to build minimum vaillable product or proof of concept more faster with web language.

### Skills
- Software prototyping
- Empathy

## Some of my others training with vue.js
I learn myself how build spa, pwa with dynamic content. I have learn some backend basis with node.js.
I am also able to manage npm project with command line interface. 
I have learned a lot about all technical stack in production, and talk with a lot of developpers about their practice.
Without losing sight of my designer goals and methodology.
