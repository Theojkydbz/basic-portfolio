## Some of my others training with vue.js
<p class="marge">I learn myself how build spa, pwa with dynamic content. I have learn some backend basis with node.js.
I am also able to manage npm project with command line interface. 
I have learned a lot about all technical stack in production, and talk with a lot of developpers about their practice.
Without losing sight of my designer goals and methodology.</p>
