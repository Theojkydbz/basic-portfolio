## Overview

<p class="marge">I have to experiment and conceive an internal product with conversational user interface during my latest internship at <a href="http://emotic.fr" target="_blank">Emotic</a>.</p> 



<p class="marge">As a strong company in the Nantes technology ecosystem, Emotic wanted to take ownership of conversational interface product design. 
it's a buzzword in today's Nantes digital industry. But it's a technology that it about to revolutionize many things in our daily life.</p>

<p class="marge">As an intern, when I wasn't busy with client projects I had to experiment and document the subject of conversational interfaces.</p>

<p class="marge">I then designed an internal product based on needs identified within the design team.
At the end of my internship my product sparked interest and we gave time to a developer to build a minimum viable product with me.</p>


## Process Overview 
![flowchart of our process](../../assets/emorkshop/Timeline.png)

## Software Prototype
<p class="marge">Simple, with help of a bot you can create a workshops and spend time on reflexion instead of create slide.
The bot create all your slide and help you to think all the supply you have to don't forget.</p>

<p class="marge">It's my latest proof of concept that demonstrates use cases! </p>

## Research

<p class="marge">I did a lot of research to better understand the conversational and vocal interface in order to build a better product and present my <a href="https://www.pearltrees.com/theojkydbz/conversationnel/id25545738" target="_blank">research</a> to the Emotic team : </p>

![field of research & presentation to the team](../../assets/emorkshop/speak.png)

<p class="marge">I also wrote a <a href="https://emotic.fr/blog/comparaison-agents-conversationnels-comprendre-interactions-entre-humain-et-intelligence-artificielle/" target="_blank">benchmark article</a> for Emotic blog</p>

## Task
<p class="marge">My role was to improve UX designer workshop workflow using conversationnal interface</p>
 
###  UX designer workshop
<p class="marge">Co-creation workshop an field of UX goals are to understand needs of user / customer in order to build an adapted experience this is characterized by vulgarization of conception principe in order to co-conceive tools with principal users</p>

###  Conversational agent
<p class="marge">Set of interactions similar to an exchange in natural language with a device able to take action, able to act</p>

## Context
<p class="marge">Workshop animation and UX Design are recent disciplines create tool for these field are an opportunity to improve rentability, efficacity and conditions of designers.</p>

>Today ux field are abstract and during co-creation workshop designer have to be focus at 100% on his audienceand forget his slide support

## User Journey
![Mapping Workflow](../../assets/emorkshop/map.png)
<p class="marge">Emotic ux designer have a workplace, they prepare workshop with G-suite. Workshop have an average timing of 4-5 hours, workshop preparation became a repetitive task and designer spend more time producing slides than thinking and discovering new exercises</p>

![overview experience map](../../assets/emorkshop/overviewexpmap.png)
![conceive experience map](../../assets/emorkshop/conceive.png)

<p class="marge">Emobot concentrates on the slide production phase, leaving the designer time to focus on understanding the need and objectives and therefore on the conception of his workshop.</p>


## Ideate
<p class="marge">I was able to lead my first workshops as a student designer, to better understand what workshop creation was all about and thus understand their needs and frustrations.</p>

## Road to minimum viable product

![Tools for my mvp](../../assets/emorkshop/mvp.png)

<p class="marge">I wanted to create a minimum viable product to test and improve my solution.</p>

![Persona for our EPO project](../../assets/emorkshop/data.png)

<p class="marge">My conversational agent needs to know a lot of exercises and workshops in order to propose them to the users.</p>

![Persona for our EPO project](../../assets/emorkshop/ooux.png)

<p class="marge">I created a platform to create workshop documentation, all designers can connect to the platform to create workshops, exercises, improve them because the content evolves very quickly, and new workshop formats appear every month.</p>

## Measure

<p class="marge">in progress</p>

## Conclusion

<p class="marge">I learned a lot with this project because I had to clearly demonstrate the value and impact of my project to my fellow designers and developers.
I am very excited about this project because the UX designers at Emotic have shown a real interest in my project</p>
