<p class="marge">Confluence is a junction. A space in which students, former students and professionals meet, work and discuss. It also opens up new possibilities for the transmission of knowledge in order to have a more natural learning path.</p>

# Context

<p class="marge">This project began from my passion for learning and my passive observations during my study and my experience of self-education, from my journey at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.42.fr/">42</a> computer programming school to the <a target="_blank" href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/mitx-courses-edx">MITx</a> online course i'm following. At <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lecolededesign.com/">lecolededesign</a>, I manage the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lecolededesign.com/">collectif404</a> with which I like to organize conferences and hackathons in order to create a learning transmission between students.</p>

# Adaptive pedagogy

![../../assets/confluence/scqdq.png](../../assets/confluence/research.jpg)
<p class="center">Multi-methodology research</p>

<p class="marge">Thanks to my curiosity, I have conducted research on pedagogy in general. The interview of Laurent Neysensas head of teaching innovation unit at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lecolededesign.com/">lecolededesign</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.richardmillwood.net/2013/05/10/learning-theory/">the learning theory v6 schema</a> by <a target="_blank" href="http://richardmillwood.net/">Dr Richar Millwood</a> and my experiences in several types of pedagogy will make me reflect about the fact that we all need a different pedagogical pattern.</p>

<p class="marge">Also i discover that concept exist, it's call adaptive learning</p>

<p class="marge">How i can help adaptive pedagogy make a learning path more fluid ?</p>

# Problem

<p class="marge">Communication technologies are increasingly being adopted by institutes and universities to improve learning systems. Through adaptability in the pedagogical environment, the learner would have access to personalized interactions, continuous monitoring of progress and facilitation of engagement in his learning.</p>

<p class="marge">Knowledge is everywhere, but we must understand it and put it into practice.</p>


## Definition

<p class="marge">To understand the subject we must understand two keys definition into pedagogy :</p>

## Our learning paths
> "Thy time like this thou shalt divide: A third in the unknown thou shalt go, Two thirds the steps of others thou shalt follow"

<p class="marge">Gerd Gigerenzer permit me to understand that former students and the professional sphere can be very useful in my concept because they have an influence on the subject (the learner).</p>

# Concept refinement

<p class="marge">Using use cases and insights based on my 2 users I start to define the concrete objectives of the application.</p>

## Aim of the project

<p class="marge">1. Limiting a learner's frustrations through coaching</p>

<p class="marge">2. Bringing sharing between students and professionals</p>

<p class="marge">3. Guiding the student towards discovery through practice</p>

# Information architecture

![../../assets/confluence/Untitled.png](../../assets/confluence/processinformation.jpg)
<p class="center">Information architecture process</p>

<p class="marge">From my list of objectives, I was able to analyze the different types of users with a semiotic square. I led a co-creation workshop with a student that allows me to collect the kind of data that makes sense in this context for students.</p>

![../../assets/confluence/Untitled.png](../../assets/confluence/squarecocrea.jpg)
<p class="center">Understand & collect data</p>

<p class="marge">With the data that makes sense to students, I was able to create an ontology of the ecosystem, this categorization helps me to better understand design issues</p>

![../../assets/confluence/Untitled.png](../../assets/confluence/cardsorting.jpg)
<p class="center">Organize data</p>


# Design
![../../assets/confluence/Untitled.png](../../assets/confluence/processdesign.jpg)
<p class="center">Design process</p>
<p class="marge">In order to prototype efficiently, I started with a paper prototype and did my first test on a paper version</p>

## Paper prototype
![../../assets/confluence/Untitled.png](../../assets/confluence/lowfi.jpg)
<p class="center">My room wall, full of prototype</p>

<p class="marge">During containment, I used a wall in my room to display all versions and user flow so that I could make informed decisions that move me forward.</p>
<p class="marge">Here are some of my boards synthesizing my progress or enlightening my decisions :</p>

### Meeting
<p class="marge">To have contacts in the application to work with, to ask for help, you have to participate in "Mentor Dating" in video-conversation. These "Mentor Dating" are short video exchanges of 5 minutes that let the sympathy/personal side speak more and not only the skills/professional side. This allows you to see who you would like to be in contact with as a Mentor/Student.</p>


### Discussion
<p class="marge">Once the meeting is complete, the mentor and student can be added. They then have an environment designed for factual/rapid exchange and resource sharing.</p>

![../../assets/confluence/Untitled.png](../../assets/confluence/lowfi1.jpg)
<p class="center">[v1] Low-fidelity core experiences</p>


### Navigation
<p class="marge">The 2 tab bar is the best solution because it highlights the two main functions of the product, meeting or exchanging with a contact.</p>

<p class="center">[v1.2] Navigation test</p>

![../../assets/confluence/Untitled.png](../../assets/confluence/lowfi3.jpg)
<p class="center">[v1.2] Low-fidelity core experiences</p>
<p class="marge">Once my userflows were confirmed and nested by paper prototype, I could see much more clearly in the features present, some disappear for lack of meaning and others gain momentum</p>

## Userflow
<p class="marge">This user flow is based on the ontology of my ecosystem, it establishes a correlation between the information displayed and the actions of the users.</p>

<p class="center">Userflow</p>

<p class="marge"> This low-fidelity model on "sketch" allows me to </p>
<p class="marge">1) Fix & clean my paper mock-ups</p>
<p class="marge">2) Precisely manage the layout, spaces/margins.</p>
<p class="marge">3) Conditionally test</p>

## High-fidelity

<p class="center">High-fidelity core experiences</p>


### Issue story

<p class="marge">The student will dare to ask for help with orientation, professional choices or recommendations on his or her practices thanks to the "Issue Story" feature. It allows him to ask a question or a problem in the form of stories that the mentor will be able to answer easily.</p>

### Don't disturb

<p class="marge">The professional has a quick tool for managing notifications to avoid being disturbed by messages.</p>

<p class="center">High-fidelity notifications manager</p>

### Private Meeting

<p class="marge">Organizations and companies can create "Mentor Dating" salons. They will provide a code that will allow their employees/members and students to log in.</p>

# Conclusion

<p class="marge">Our two interlocutors will be linked in a relationship that goes beyond the simple professional world. It opens up new possibilities for the transmission of knowledge in order to have a more natural learning path composed with human relation, contact and exchange</p>
<p class="marge">It's the first time I've gone so deeply into the information architecture in a project, I really liked using these principles because I feel that the information and the structure of the product are intertwined.</p>
<p class="marge">I put aside many aspects of pedagogy such as feedback and data visualization, this could be an improvement to consider.</p>
