## Context

![stats for context](../../assets/epo/stats.png)
> 99.2% of individuals have an information medium
[cairn.info](https://www.cairn.info/revue-reseaux-2010-2-page-225.htm#)

Why are we interested in the information:
![brainstorm for context](../../assets/epo/brainstorm.png)
Social media has a responsibility to reflect reality.

## Concept
Today all information is given with intent. People want develop their view point to reach their verity

> How to detach the bias of a journalistic article to allow the user to form his opinion ?

> By the use of time, how to allow the user to inform himself and confront his ideas ?


### Description
A service whose function is to gather journalistic articles so that each user can interpret them 
and make his opinion, as well as give his opinion.
An app with a time feature to decrease infobesity.
### Expectations
Users want to share their opinion and have a confrontation in divergent opinions.
Being informed in a reliable and regular way is the priority in the application.
While being able to verify the information.

## Ideate 

### Goals
![Goals for our EPO project](../../assets/epo/goals.png)


### Low fidelity
We have reach a use case with a kind of playlist builder to time experience of user
![low fidelity proto for our EPO project](../../assets/epo/lowfidelity.png)
### Iterate
Also, tried to improve our pencil paper models as much as possible before moving on to the high fidelity prototyping
![low fidelity tests for our EPO project](../../assets/epo/lowtest.png)


## Oriented Object User Experience
In order to build a better information architecture, I mapped the entire application architecture to understand
where and in what form the interface components are used
![Hero render for our Smartimer project](../../assets/epo/oouxchart.png)
The main component is the article, so I prioritize information that has a better impact on our users.

## Logo Design
![Hero render for our Smartimer project](../../assets/epo/logo.png)
- E = elefthería (grec) = freedom (en)
- P = pliroforíes (grec) = information (en)
- O = óra (grc) = time (en)

## Prototype

### High fidelity
![Hero render for our Smartimer project](../../assets/epo/screen.png)
Timer send you alert signal for stop our reading.

### Technical stack

## Iterate
### User tests
We decided to test during the morning our high fidelity prototype on people on the bus.

## Conclusion
We have tackled a very difficult problem and I think social networks are a very complex field. so I think I need to explore and better understand this field because connecting people across distance and other constraints is really exciting.
