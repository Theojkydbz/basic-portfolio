## Context

![stats for context](../../assets/epo/stats.png)
> 99.2% of individuals have an information medium
[cairn.info](https://www.cairn.info/revue-reseaux-2010-2-page-225.htm#)

<p class="marge">Why are we interested in the information:</p>

![brainstorm for context](../../assets/epo/brainstorm.png)
<p class="marge">Social media has a responsibility to reflect reality.</p>

## Concept
<p class="marge">Today all information is given with intent. People want develop their view point to reach their verity</p>

> How to detach the bias of a journalistic article to allow the user to form his opinion ?

> By the use of time, how to allow the user to inform himself and confront his ideas ?


### Description
<p class="marge">A service whose function is to gather journalistic articles so that each user can interpret them 
and make his opinion, as well as give his opinion.
An app with a time feature to decrease infobesity.</p>

### Expectations
<p class="marge">Users want to share their opinion and have a confrontation in divergent opinions.
Being informed in a reliable and regular way is the priority in the application.
While being able to verify the information.</p>

## Ideate 

### Goals
![Goals for our EPO project](../../assets/epo/goals.png)


### Low fidelity
<p class="marge">We have reach a use case with a kind of playlist builder to time experience of user</p>

![low fidelity proto for our EPO project](../../assets/epo/lowfidelity.png)
### Iterate
<p class="marge">Also, tried to improve our pencil paper models as much as possible before moving on to the high fidelity prototyping</p>

![low fidelity tests for our EPO project](../../assets/epo/lowtest.png)


## Oriented Object User Experience
<p class="marge">In order to build a better information architecture, I mapped the entire application architecture to understand
where and in what form the interface components are used</p>

![Hero render for our Smartimer project](../../assets/epo/oouxchart.png)
<p class="marge">The main component is the article, so I prioritize information that has a better impact on our users.</p>

## Logo Design
![Hero render for our Smartimer project](../../assets/epo/logo.png)

- E = elefthería (grec) = freedom (en)
- P = pliroforíes (grec) = information (en)
- O = óra (grc) = time (en)

## Prototype

### High fidelity
![Hero render for our Smartimer project](../../assets/epo/screen.png)
<p class="marge">Timer send you alert signal for stop our reading.</p>

### Technical stack

## Iterate
### User tests
<p class="marge">We decided to test during the morning our high fidelity prototype on people on the bus.</p>

![Hero render for our Smartimer project](../../assets/epo/usertests.png)

## Conclusion
<p class="marge">We have tackled a very difficult problem and I think social networks are a very complex field. so I think I need to explore and better understand this field because connecting people across distance and other constraints is really exciting.</p>
