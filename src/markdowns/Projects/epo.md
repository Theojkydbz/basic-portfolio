it also provides an opportunity to learn how to manage it while implementing self-regulation. It brings urgency and efficiency to the task of our user : For meeting, rapid prototyping, creative workshop, simple tasks, workshop. Using the principle of the timer, the Smartimer of Galaxy removes its authoritarian character thanks to approximate data and by removing precise measurement. Smartimer of Galaxy is connected to our calendar and all our events and as soon as it is on, our events and tasks are materialized in time and have an expiration.
