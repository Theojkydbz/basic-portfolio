## Overview
<p class="marge">I was involved with Master's Degree students in Cumulus Green 2020 competition. For this entry, the goal was to make sense of the circular economy. The goal for us was to create a platform that makes the circular economy accessible to the largest number. I took care of user interview for the product definition with the team, of the whole interface and reflection around usability. My teammates focused on economic viability, graphic choices and competition presentation</p>
