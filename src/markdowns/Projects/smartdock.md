## Context
<p class="marge">During the containment, I managed the organization of a remote "hackathon" within the school, "HACKARANTAINE" is a hackathon on discord and my role was to make contact with mentors/potential participants, I was in charge of the whole upstream phase of the event. I then decided to participate as the rest of the collective was in charge of the event and did not need any reinforcement. After the hackarantaine I decide with an industrial design student to continue research and product design</p>


## As a user I would like to improve my habits, to get into my workflow


<p class="marge">being in containment we focused on our respective equipment and workspaces.</p>

<p class="marge">In this project, we explored how we can help people get to work more effectively through habit. Focusing specifically on the smartphone that governs many habits, which contains many tools for user routines, we realized that the phone for many people does not lead to the transition to a work state because it contains both work, staff, and relaxation. Users need to gain digital hygiene to be driven on the platforms and functionalities related to their physical actions and intentions.</p>

## Concept
<p class="marge">With SmartDock, we want to connect real space to digital space. Create a natural link between what you can do with our smartphone and the real life context.</p>
